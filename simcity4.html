    <h2>About SimCity 4 modding, for the uninitiated</h2>
    <p>Within the SimCity 4 (SC4) modding world, I was traditionally a lotter. Lotters create "lots", which are the foundational concept of the game. A lot will contain buildings and props (cars, plants, fences or anything else to make the lot look "alive" in game. Lotters commonly will use assets 3D modeled and published by other community members and assemble them on their lot. While many community modders took a hybrid role in both modeling and creating the lots, I stuck purely to creating lots.  </p>
    
    
    <h2>My Main Projects</h2>
    <p>Through the years, my experiences modding the game have allowed me to experiment with a wide vareity of skills, including graphic design of icons in Photoshop, Photoshop scripting, HTML, CSS, and now C# - in addition to all of the specific game knowledge on how the game and mods for the game are supposed to work.</p>
    <p>My main projects can be broken down into two categories: Lotting Projects, and Development (coding) projects.</p>

    <h3>Lotting Projects</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>B62 Remastered</summary>
        
        <p>B62 Remastered was a comprehensive lotting effort to release all of the content created by <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/38151-bobbo662/">Bobbo662</a> (aka B62). B62 was a prolific 3D modeler in the early days of SimCity 4 modding around 2004 or 2005. As was common in the early days of modding the game, players were constantly learning new things about the inner workings of the game. After releasing a ton of content on community exchanges for players to download, a parent cohort modding error was discovered in all of Bobbo662's files (which caused them to not appear in the game at all - a serious issue) and he removed everything from the exchanges with two exceptions.</p>
        <p>After contacting him personally to use the removed files for personal reasons, he was incredibly kind to send over all of the content he still had sitting on a hard drive. This is the beginning of the <i>B62 Remastered</i> collection.</p>
        <p>However, Bobbo662 was only still in possession of about half of the content he created, so with assistance of community members <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/698707-tariely/">tariely</a>, <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/424625-daviddhetzel/">DavidDHetzel</a>, <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/192946-brad88/">brad88</a>, and <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/364367-pclark06/">pclark06</a> who all sent the B62 content they each had stored, the full collection was pieced together.</p>
        <p>Much of the process in creating and sharing the <i>B62 Remastered</i> collection was logged in my <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/64886-nos17-lot-development/">lotting thread at Simtropolis</a>, dating back to 2014.</p>

    <h3>Development Projects</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>SimCity 4 Prop + Texture Catalog</summary>

        <p>Hosted online <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-prop-and-texture-catalog/index/">here</a> and downloaded <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34032-simcity-4-prop-texture-catalog/"></a>, is a much expanded version of the <a href="https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=13364.0">original catalog</a> at SC4Devotion. I wanted to create a resource for lot creators that is a) much expanded - a lot of new content has been released or changed since the first version in 2011, and b) make it much easier to use.</p>
        <p>The intent of this tool is to provide and invaluable resource for content creators (and especially lotters) who are looking for more and better content to incorporate into their work. Looking for a motorcycle to add to your lot? Then filter only prop packs that contain vehicles and/or motorcycles. Looking for seasonal trees? Look through all packs that contain seasonal trees until you can find the right ones for you. Want to use all High Definition rendered props? Scour all packs that contain HD props to find the ones you want.</p>

        <details class="SmallerDetails">
            <summary>Early versions (2.x.x)</summary>
            <p>The early versions of this catalog (versions 2.x.x) were HTML and image based, with JavaScript to allow for dynamic filtering and sorting of prop and texture packs. The source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/noah-severyn/SC4PropTextureCatalog">GitHub repository.</a></p>
            <p>The catalog provided the option to search for prop or texture packs by category,</p>

            <p>or search for props by TGI (a unique identifier used by the game), author who created the prop, or the prop name.</p>

        </details>
    
        <details class="SmallerDetails">
            <summary>Later versions (3.x.x)</summary>
            <p>As the size of the database grew with almost 50,000 items in an HTML table, performance obviously began to degrade so I begun work on a newer version no HTML/JavaScript based that would be easily able to handle a database of that size. This is currently in progress. See also other Development Projects for related updates.</p>
